# Language Learning Stats Application (LLSA)

**LLSA** is a desktop application built with Avalonia UI for language learners who want to monitor their progress in **listening** and **speaking practice**.  
The app allows you to accumulate and track your statistics, stay motivated by watching numbers grow, and maintain consistency with the help of its **penalty and bonus system**:

- **Penalties** are applied if you fail to meet your daily quota.  
- **Bonuses** are awarded to your daily quota when you complete speaking practice.  

For entering study times, LLSA uses a **key-based format**. This makes it easy to record durations in hours, minutes, and seconds.  

### ‚è± Examples of time input:

3h 6m 7s
45m
1h 20m 15s
